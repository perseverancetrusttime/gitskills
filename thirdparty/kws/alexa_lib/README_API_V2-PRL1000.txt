- models/*: models for the wakeword engine
    - <model_format>/[model].*: Wake-word models in various formats.
        Please refer to the model_compatibility.json file for selecting a model format compatible
        with a given architecture. The .cpp file is a source code representation of the model,
        for static compilation into your application. The .bin file is a binary representation of
        the model, to be loaded at run-time by your application.

Notes on Model / Engine Types
=============================
There are several types of engines that support various types of wakeword models:

- "D" class (larger CPU/Mem footprint, better performance)
- "U" and "W" class (smaller CPU/Mem footprint, lower performance)

If a binary contains a "-U" suffix, it only supports "U" and "W" type wakeword models.
If the binary contains no suffix, it supports all types of wakeword models.
If the binary contains a "-PRL1000", it only supports "U" and "W" type wakeword models.
Be sure to check return codes from the API calls to detect errors.

Be sure to use the engine with the associated models from this version of the package only.
The engine is not guaranteed to be compatible with models from other versions of the package.

1.12.0 (2019-January-31)
- Models format change

1.11.3 (2019-January-10)

1.11.1 (2018-December 27)
- Updated LICENSE.txt

1.11.0 (2018-December 10)
- Models format change.
- Optimized arm-neon model format introduced.
  ARM platforms using neon must now use these models from models/arm-neon/<model>.*

1.10.1 (2018-December 4)
- Add support for "W" type models. These are usable with the "U" and universal type engines.

1.10.0 (2018-November-26)
- Models format change

1.9.6 (2018-November 8)
- Bugfix: improve accuracy of detection indices

1.9.5 (2018-October-16)
- Metadata Update

1.9.4 (2018-October-15)
- Bugfix: Allow optional vadCallback parameter to be NULL when useVad = true

1.9.3 (2018-October-12)
- Bugfix: Validation of model configuration

1.9.2 (2018-October-10)
- Moved api_sample.cpp to <architecture>/

1.9.1 (2018-September-21)
- Add support for larger model sizes

1.9.0 (2018-August-14)
- Revert change of start and end indices from 1.6.0, back to long long absolute sample indices.

1.8.0 (2018-August-8)
- Added a userData variable in the PryonLiteDecoderConfig and PryonLiteResult structures
  user can pass data while initializing the decoder and can obtain the the data in the
  PryonLiteResult in the callback. Added the userData in VAD callback.

1.7.0 (2018-August-2)
- Change sample data container from int to short. Sample must be 16 bit right aligned.
- Make pryon_lite.h architecture-specific and move it into the architecture folder

1.6.0 (2018-July-19)
- Change sample data container from a short to an int. Samples must be 16 bit right aligned data
  in this integer container.
- Change start and end indices in the result structure to be negative offsets from the most
  recent pushed frame.
    - Prior to this change the beginSampleIndex and endSampleIndex in the PryonLiteResult struct
      were long long values. The values were absolute sample indices.
    - After this change the two indices are integers. These values are negative offsets from the
      most recent sample pushed to the engine through the PryonLiteDecoder_PushAudioSamples call.
    - If the only information needed from the result is the relative index or the duration of the
      wakeword then there are no application code changes needed.
    - If the absolute indices are still required, the application code must keep track of how many
      samples are pushed to the decoder and add that value to the relative indices. In general this
      means adding the value of the sampleCount parameter passed to
      PryonLiteDecoder_PushAudioSamples to a global counter whenever the function succeeds. Then
      when a detection is seen, add this global counter to the beginSampleIndex and endSampleIndex.

1.5.0 (2018-July-16)
- Models format change

1.4.0 (2018-June-29)
- Models format change

1.3.0 (2018-May-15)
- Addition of near-miss threshold to report possible wakeword utterances that did
  not break the required confidence threshold

1.2.0 (2018-May-14)
- Changed the boolean values in PryonLiteDecoderConfig struct to integer values.

1.1.0 (2018-May-10)
- Addition of support for querying the maximum size of the metadata blob returned as
  part of a detection result, via the PryonLite_GetEngineAttributes() API call.

1.0.3 (2018-Apr-26)
- Addition of "confidence" to detection result. The confidence is an integer between 0
  (lowest) and 1000 (highest)

1.0.2 (2018-Apr-03)
- Addition of PryonLiteDecoder_SetDetectionThreshold() API call to set the detection
  threshold at run-time. This is useful for scenarios such as music playback when the
  application might want more sensitive detection behavior.

1.0.1 (2018-Feb-01)
- Addition of "lowLatency" mode, valid only for "U" class models. This configuration
  parameter will reduce latency by 225 ms on average. Disabled by default - to enable,
  set PryonLiteDecoderConfig.lowLatency = true.

1.0.0 (2018-Jan-22)
- Initial revision
