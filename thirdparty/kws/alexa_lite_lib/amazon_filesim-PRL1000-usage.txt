The enclosed binary is a .wav file processor for the Amazon Wakeword Engine. A text file containing
a list of .wav files must be supplied.  The Wakeword Engine will process all files in the list.

If you have a directory containing the .wav files to process, run the following command to generate
a list file with all the .wav files in that directory:

ls -1 *.wav > all_wavs.list

Then run the simulator:

./amazon_filesim-PRL1000 -m <path_to_model> all_wavs.list

The wakeword engine executable is compatible with wakeword model types with the prefix letter U.

The wakeword engine uses adaptation logic to learn the characteristics of the acoustic environment. This improves
detection quality. However if the audio clips are from different environments and do not contain at least 1 second of
background noise prior to the wakeword, we suggest using -c which will cause the engine to clear the adaptation stats
after each file.

Sample .wav files, .list file and output from the included .wav file processor can be found in the sample-wakeword folder.

For a full list of of options, run amazon_filesim-PRL1000 with '-h'.
